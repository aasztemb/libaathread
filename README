C threading library based on userland context switching

Possible problems are described here:

https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/System-V-contexts.html

"It is not recommended to do the context switching from the signal
 handler directly since leaving the signal handler via setcontext if
 the signal was delivered during code that was not asynchronous signal
 safe could lead to problems."
